<h1>Ansible Playbooks to be deploy on Kubernetes clusters</h1>
<h2>Available Playbooks</h2>
<p>- Apache2 (httpd)</p>
<p>- Nginx</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>For an easier comprehension, instead of doing a single file that regroups your playbook, the deployment and the pod, they are in a separate folder.</p>
<p>For each, a Deploy and Pod folder is availble</p>
